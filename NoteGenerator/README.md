# I made it so the program first checks to see if it is an equal or just note. It then passes 
# the note along with if it equal or just into a calculations step that calculation the steps of notes
# needed to create the chord from there it will then call the respective frequency calculator to for the 3 notes.
# After that we input the three frequencies along with the note and equal or just
# 

# The program went all right it wasn't to hard to code. Until I got to major keys.
# I couldn't figure out how to add major keys and was on a time crunch so that still has to be done. 
# Other than that the code should function correctly.
